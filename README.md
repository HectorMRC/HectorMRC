### Hi there, I'm HÃ¨ctor ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a software engineer

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects on [alvidir](https://github.com/alvidir) organization.
- ðŸŒ± My main stack is Go and Rust, but also Vue3 + Typescript when beautiful front-ends are required.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: the easiest way is via email <hector.morales.carnice@gmail.com>.
- :bulb: Software projects are like cakes: presentation has to be good, but the ingredients must be the best.
